Do ticket 12 error handling

Improve desktop view of feed - different sized articles? ensure pics don't squash?

currently access token isn't stored as secure or http only (on react side)?

Add filtering and pagination for comments and profile stuff

add hover effect to comment and star logo - change hue of png and then hue rotate.

add no articles found message not empty screen on feed

add asc and desc to filters

If you click on title or feed button, it should go back to basic feed with no filters. Can I do this without reloading the page? if not just <a> tag it.

Improve error handling. E.g. if topic doesn't exist, say so. All errors look like 500s at the moment.

How do I catch bad routes with react router?
