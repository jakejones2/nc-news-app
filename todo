Do ticket 12 error handling

Fix desktop view of feed - different sized articles?

currently access token isn't stored as secure or http only (on react side)

Add filtering and pagination for comments and profile stuff

when logging in, you go to your previous page or feed

add hover effect to comment and star logo - change hue of png and then hue rotate.

are you sure? modal on logout and delete, should make a reusable component for this
